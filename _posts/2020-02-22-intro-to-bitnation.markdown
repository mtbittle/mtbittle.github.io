I have no idea how you've found yourself in this small corner of GitHub Pages, but welcome!

I've been developing software professionally since 2008, and consider myself somewhat of a jack of all trades
developer. Right out of college, I was thrown to the wolves, working on a J2EE, EJB 3.1-based project. It was a 
steep learning curve to be sure.

Over the years, I've had my hands in everything from XML schema design and XSLT transformations, writing
RHEL kickstarter scripts, a little Groovy on Grails, JMS, Struts 2, and Spring MVC, Data JPA, Batch. Currently focused on transitioning
enterprise applications from monolithic structures to container-based cloud microservices, continuous integration
and deployment using Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes.

Everyone's using Git, Maven, and Gradle these days with Spring Boot, Docker images, and lightweight application servers these days.
It's really impressive how the industry, technology, and frameworks have matured over the years. I still remember using
Subversion and ClearCase for version control, managing dependencies manually, and continually hearing, "well, it works on my machine!"

Hoping I can share some experience, continue learning and sharing projects/ideas, and maybe inspire a few people
that somehow found their way here.
